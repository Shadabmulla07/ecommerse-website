This project is a full-featured E-commerce web application built with Flask (Python) that allows users to browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and securely checkout using a payment gateway like Stripe. It includes admin controls for managing products, categories, and orders, as well as a user-friendly interface for customers to shop multiple items in a single transaction.
